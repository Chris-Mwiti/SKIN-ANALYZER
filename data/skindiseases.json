Here are some examples:\n\n    Bleeding: Uterine fibroids are an example of benign tumors that cause bleeding.\n    Changes in your skin: Benign skin tumors may cause many different symptoms, from tiny red spots no larger than a pinhead and small bumps (cellular dermatofibromas) to clusters of skin tissue at the top of a tiny stalk (acrochordons).\n    Difficulty breathing: Chondromas and hamartomas that affect your airway may make it hard for you to breathe.\n    Headaches and dizziness: A meningioma (benign tumor in your meninges) may cause several symptoms, but headache and dizziness are among the most common ones.\n    Loss of appetite or weight loss: A lipoma or fibroma pressing on your stomach may affect your appetite.\n    Pain: Benign bone tumors often cause pain that doesn't go away and gets worse.",

For example, you may not need treatment if you have a benign tumor that's not growing or causing any issues. In that case, a healthcare provider may recommend watchful waiting. In watchful waiting, your provider will schedule regular follow-ups so they can watch for changes in your body.\n\nIf there are changes, your provider may:\n\n    Prescribe medications to manage symptoms like pain or swelling.\n    Recommend surgery to remove a benign tumor that's causing symptoms because it's pressing on tissues or organs."

In darker skin colors, the redness may be harder to see. Drug eruptions may involve the entire skin surface, or they may be limited to one or a few body parts. Most often, the rash appears in skin fold areas such as the underarms or groin, on the trunk, or on the arms and legs.\n\nItching is common with many drug eruptions, and there may be a fever. If a fever is present, the skin is tender, or the membranes inside the mouth or the genitalia are involved, then a more serious skin condition may be present",
      "treatment": "If your medical professional suspects a drug eruption, they may want to establish the correct diagnosis by performing a biopsy of the lesion. In addition, they may want to perform blood work to look for signs of an allergic reaction.\n\nThe best treatment for a drug eruption is to stop the medication that is causing it. However, stopping a prescription medication should be done only with a medical professional's guidance. After discontinuing a medicine, it may take 5-10 days to see an improvement in the skin and up to 3 weeks for the rash to resolve completely.\n\nOther treatments to improve symptoms may include:\n\n    Oral antihistamine pills, such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, or loratadine, for itching.\n    Topical corticosteroid (cortisone) creams or lotions for red, inflamed skin.\n    Oral corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) for severe eruptions.\n    Topical antibiotic ointments for open sores."
